# ERA
Earth Regeneration Age

The following repository contains the Designs for ERA protocol and framework, which is the collection of several years working towards a system for global scale protection and regeneration.

The basis for the system is to use Uber H3 library to provide a hierarchical structure in which to root Earth Cells based on the H3 unique ID at different resolutions. This Earth Cells will be rooted with their unique ID and with its current state (Satellite data or other data sources) and from it an NFT (Non Fungible Token will be created). The token will represent a concrete protection and/or regeneration potential with an initial state.

Follow up actions will value/ devalue the token based on actions and claims. All objetivery measured. 

Protection and Regeneration claims can take place towards any given Earth Cell. Once the claims are validated with Proof of Existence (PoE) and/or Proof of Action (PoA) the Proof of Protection (PoP) or Proof of Regeneration (PoR) will be achieved, which will allow for the claim to be rewarded by tokens, linked to those NFT's.
