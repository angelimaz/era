# ERA
Earth Regeneration Age

The following repository contains the Designs for ERA protocol and framework, which is the collection of several years working towards a system for global scale protection and regeneration.

The basis for the system is to use Uber H3 to provide a hierarchical structure in which to root Earth Cells based on the H3 unique ID at different resolutions. This Earth Cells will be rooted with a their unique ID and which is current state (Satellite data or other data sources) and from it an NFT (Non Fungible Token will be created). The token will represent a concrete protection and/or regeneration potential with an initial state.

Follow up actions will value/ devalue the token based on actions and claims. All objetivery measured.
